# Face GAN #

The implementation on pytorch of the fully deep convolutional generative adversial network,
tries to create realistic faces of the CelebA datastet. The architecture and model
hyperparameters are based on the paper
"Unsupervised representation learning with DCGANs" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)
