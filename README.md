# Face GAN #

This repo includes the implementation on pytorch of a fully deep convolutional generative adversial network,
that tries to create realistic faces of the CelebA datastet. The architecture and model
hyperparameters are based on the paper
"Unsupervised representation learning with DCGANs" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)
<br>
It includes three different models based on the same architecture:
    * DCGAN
    * WGAN
    * WGAN-GP
### Generated images sample ###
